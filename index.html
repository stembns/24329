                <div class="abstract-content">
                    <p>Sometimes, when we face a problem, we think of finding solutions outside the scope of the problem itself. Often, however, the solution lies within the problem itself. This is where we began to address the problem of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion here refers to the increased number of vehicles compared to the available road space. To solve this problem, we researched prior solutions that addressed the same issue and found the Sydney Harbor Tunnel project. This project is unique in its ability to decrease traffic congestion and also save travel time. We were able to develop a model for solving this problem by using the pros of this solution and others, and solving the cons in them. We arrived at the idea of building a movable bridge in the middle of the road. The bridge moves upwards using a hydraulic system. When the hydraulic system pump is activated, the bridge opens, and the pump then pumps the fluid from the syringe. When there is traffic congestion, the bridge rises, allowing it to able to bear the same number of vehicles normally occupying the road. We used the laptop's camera to detect traffic congestion by programming it with AI. From the images, the camera can determine whether the road is congested or not, and we used mq-135 sensor to detect the air pollution. We concluded that the project features traffic flow, and the efficiency the prototype is improving by 37.2%. Then we calculate the time response, which was 6.8 seconds.</p>

                        <h3>Rotated Camera System</h3>
                        <p>Using a rotated camera instead of a laptop camera with its Raspberry Pi. Because it can receive all data accurately and count all things on the road with its identification.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Hydraulic Pistons</h3>
                        <p>Using hydraulic pistons instead of a syringe because hydraulic pistons can bear the load of the actual bridge.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="card-number">3</div>
                        <h3>PAO Hydraulic Oil</h3>
                        <p>Using oil called PAO hydraulic oil – ISO VG46 in the hydraulic pistons instead of water because it has high thermal stability, and is suitable for heavy loads.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="recommendation-card">

                        <h3>High-Power Pump</h3>
                        <p>Use a larger pump when moving to large-scale applications. A stronger pump around 100 kW will be able to push larger amounts of water smoothly and quickly, making the whole process more effective.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Strategic Location Deployment</h3>
                        <p>Building the project in a place which works a few times each week, during short traffic peaks of about 45–90 minutes. It's perfect for our smart bridge. It only moves when traffic is heavy, saving energy and showing clearly how it eases congestion, like Abbuda station.</p>
